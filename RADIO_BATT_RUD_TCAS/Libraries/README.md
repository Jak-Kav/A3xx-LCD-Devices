These are the raw library files to work with the LCD.

Our library depends on the ‘HT1621.h’ library to communicate with the HT1621 LCD driver.
You need to include the ‘HT1621.h’ and ‘HT1621.cpp’ files in your project as well.
The files can be found at [https://github.com/Jak-Kav/MobiFlight-FirmwareSource/tree/main/src/MF_LCDDisplay](https://github.com/Jak-Kav/MobiFlight-FirmwareSource/tree/main/src/MF_LCDDisplay)
